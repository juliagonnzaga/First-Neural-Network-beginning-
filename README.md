# First Neural Network

Neural Network exercises for Machine Learning and Data Science.  

## Getting Started

```bash
    $ python perceptron.py
```

## Next Steps

-  ☑️ Create a perceptron neuron from scratch. 
- 🔲 Use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) to create a Multilayer Perceptron Network.
- 🔲 Use [keras](https://keras.io/) to create a deep learning model.
